             <p> Talent acquisition at <strong> HireMaster </strong>
                    The application process at HireMaster is pretty simple and straightforward. 
                    First, feel free to learn more about our company and the open positions available. 
                    If you spot a position you're interested in and qualified for, just complete our 
                    short application and submit your resume.
                    A member of our talent acquisition team will review your submission and if your experience aligns,
                    the company to which you applied to will reach out to schedule a call to have a conversation. 
                    And we do mean conversation. This is not only your first moment to put your best foot forward,
                    but also a moment to ask questions about the role.</p>

                   <p> The interview process is where things can get interesting-for both of us. 
                    Each functional area at HireMaster has a different order and process for interviewing,
                     but all include a few behavioral and situational questions, and, always, time for you to ask questions.
                      For example:
                      
                      
                         <li> Sales:  For a sales position, you can expect a virtual "Day in the Life" 
                            interview with a team member in that role who can speak to day-to-day expectations.

                             Tech:  For a tech position, you can expect to complete a take-home 
                        Hackerrank or Woven technical assessment in addition to a "Day in the Life" interview.
